# backup windows wifi passwords
first software that backup wifi passwords from windows without admin permition 

the software is based on netsh backup but not the traditional backup cause some windows backup passwords as hash even with admin permition so the idea is getting profiles name then run netsh for each profile it didn't requere admin permition bu in those cases you must run it with admin permition:
- in /tmp/ folder  it will show you acces not permeted
- in / (c://) will show you the same message  so avoid these directories
it work fine in desktop or appdata folders ....



+ can be usefull in some softwares üòÅ
